README for Perl extension CPAN-Mini-Visit-Simple

CPAN::Mini::Visit::Simple - Lightweight traversal of a minicpan repository.

This is a variant on David Golden's App-CPAN-Mini-Visit.

Note:  For meaningful results, please install a 'minicpan' first.  See:
http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-Mini/

To install on Unix-ish systems:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.
